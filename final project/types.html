        <h2>Common Tree Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Deciduous Trees</li>
            <li>Coniferous Trees</li>
            <li>Tropical Trees</li>
            <li>Fruit Trees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Trees are incredibly diverse and can be categorized into several common types based on their characteristics and habitats. Deciduous trees are known for shedding their leaves annually, often showcasing vibrant colors in autumn before going dormant in winter; examples include maple, oak, and birch. Coniferous trees, or evergreens, retain their needle-like leaves throughout the year and are commonly found in colder climates; pine, spruce, and fir are typical examples. Tropical trees thrive in warm, humid regions and often have broad leaves, such as mango, mahogany, and rubber trees. Fruit trees are cultivated for their edible produce and include familiar varieties like apple, cherry, and orange trees. Each type of tree plays a unique role in its ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity, climate regulation, and human sustenance.</p>
