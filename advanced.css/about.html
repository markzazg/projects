        <h2>About Violin</h2>
        <p>The violin is one of the most expressive and recognizable instruments in the world. 
                It first appeared in 16th-century Italy and quickly became essential in orchestras, 
                chamber music, and solo performances. Its four strings are played with a bow, 
                allowing musicians to create a wide range of tones—from soft and lyrical to powerful and emotional.</p>

            <p>Violins are crafted with great precision using woods like spruce and maple. 
                Each part—from the curved body to the delicate sound post—affects the instrument’s tone and resonance. 
                Whether used in classical, jazz, or folk music, the violin continues to inspire musicians around the world 
                with its beautiful sound and versatility.</p>
